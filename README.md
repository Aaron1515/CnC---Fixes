TO FIX:

1. Open File Explorer   (You can do this easily by right clicking the little window or Start on the bottom left of your screen and selecting File Explorer)
..1 Click Windows_OS :C (C Drive)
..1 Open Program Files (x86)
..1 Open Origin Games Folder (not Origin)
Open Command & Conquer Tiberium Sun Folder (keep this window open for step two)
Scroll down until you find the Game (File Type Application)
Highlight game by single clicking on it, then right click to bring up the pop-up menu
Select Properties at the bottom of the pop-up menu
Select the Compatability tab in the Game Properties window
Check the box "Run this program in compatabilty mode for:"
Select Windows XP (Service Pack 2)
Also check the box below that says "Reduce Color Mode"
Then set the color mode to 16-bit color
Also check the box "Run this program as an admistrator"
Apply Settings and Then Click Okay
Half way there......

Next Download this file and then open the folder.  I promise there is no malware or anything negative, just a few simple files.  (Copy and paste if below link doesn't work)

Click to save the file and once it downloads open the folder, you should see the file Win8fix, open this and follow remaining instructions

Once again Open File Explorer   
Click Windows_OS :C (C Drive)
Open Program Files (x86)
Open Origin Games Folder (not Origin)
Open Command & Conquer Tiberium Sun Folder
